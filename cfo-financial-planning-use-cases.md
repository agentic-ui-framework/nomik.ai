# CFO Financial Planning & Analysis - Detailed Use Cases

## Overview
Financial Planning & Analysis (FP&A) is the strategic backbone of CFO operations, encompassing budgeting, forecasting, variance analysis, and strategic decision support. This document provides detailed use cases showing how Nomik's agent-native platform transforms traditional FP&A from manual, time-intensive processes to autonomous, real-time strategic insights.

## Use Case 1: Real-Time Budget vs. Actual Analysis for Technology Company

### Company Profile
**CloudTech Solutions** - $1.6B revenue SaaS platform company
- **CFO**: Amanda Rodriguez
- **FP&A Team**: FP&A Director + 5 Financial Analysts
- **Challenge**: Monthly budget variance analysis takes 8 days, limiting agile decision-making
- **Business Model**: 85% recurring revenue, 15% professional services

### Traditional Monthly Variance Analysis Process

**Current State Challenge:**
- **Month-end close**: Day 5 of following month
- **Variance analysis completion**: Day 13 of following month
- **Executive reporting**: Day 15 of following month
- **Corrective actions**: Often too late for impact

### Real Example: March 2024 Variance Analysis

**Target Completion**: April 13, 2024 (for March actuals)
**Analyst Assignment**: Senior Analyst (Jessica) + Support Analyst (Tom)

### Traditional Manual Process (8 days)

**Day 1-2: Data Gathering and Reconciliation**
**Jessica - Day 1, 8:00 AM**: Export actual results from ERP

- Headcount data from Workday HRIS
- Capital expenditure data from procurement system

**Day 1, 10:00 AM**: Data quality checks
- Reconcile revenue between systems (identifies $47K variance)
- Investigate expense coding discrepancies (18 items require reclassification)
- Validate payroll allocations across departments

**Day 1, 2:00 PM**: Budget extraction and formatting
- Export approved budget from Adaptive Planning
- Reformat data to match actual reporting structure

- Review customer success metrics for churn improvement
- Analyze new customer acquisition by channel
- Document findings and business drivers

**Day 4**: Expense variance analysis
- **R&D Expenses**: $24.8M actual vs. $23.2M budget (+$1.6M unfavorable)
  - Headcount: 198 vs. 185 budgeted (ahead of hiring plan)
  - Contractor costs: $750K vs. $450K budgeted
  - Software licenses: $890K vs. $780K budgeted

**Investigation Process:**
- Interview R&D Director about accelerated hiring

## Use Case 2: Dynamic Cash Flow Forecasting for Manufacturing Company

### Company Profile
**PrecisionMfg Corp** - $2.3B revenue aerospace manufacturer
- **CFO**: Robert Chang
- **Business Model**: Long-cycle manufacturing (6-18 month production cycles)
- **Cash Challenge**: $450M working capital with seasonal fluctuations
- **Financing**: $1.2B credit facility with quarterly covenant testing

### Traditional Cash Flow Forecasting Challenge

**Current Process**: Monthly 13-week rolling cash flow forecast
**Team**: Senior Manager FP&A + 2 Financial Analysts
**Time Investment**: 40 hours monthly
**Accuracy**: ±15% variance typical

### Real Scenario: Q2 2024 Credit Facility Covenant Risk

**Date**: April 15, 2024
**Situation**: Quarterly covenant testing due April 30
**Risk**: Potential leverage ratio breach if cash flow underperforms

### Traditional 13-Week Cash Flow Process
**Team**: Senior Manager (David) + Analysts (Sarah, Mike)
**Timeline**: April 1-8 (full week)

**Day 1-2: Data Collection**
**David - Day 1**: Coordinate cross-functional inputs
- Sales team: Customer payment projections
- Operations: Production schedule and material costs
- Procurement: Supplier payment schedules
- HR: Payroll and benefit projections
- Treasury: Debt service and interest payments

**Sarah - Day 1-2**: Revenue forecasting
- Analyze $180M AR aging by customer
- Project collection timing based on payment history
- Account for seasonal payment patterns (Q2 slowdown)
- Factor in large customer payment delays (Boeing: $23M)

**Detailed Revenue Projection Example:**
- **Week 1**: $52M projected collections
  - Boeing payment delayed: $23M moved to Week 3
  - Airbus on schedule: $18M
  - General Dynamics early pay: $11M (2% discount)
- **Week 2**: $47M projected collections
- **Week 3**: $61M projected collections (includes Boeing catch-up)

**Day 3-4: Expense Forecasting**
**Mike - Day 3**: Operating expense projections
- Payroll: $38M bi-weekly + $12M monthly benefits
- Material purchases: $85M based on production schedule
- Utilities: $4.2M monthly + seasonal adjustments
- Rent and facilities: $2.8M monthly fixed costs

**Material Purchase Timing Example:**
- **Titanium alloys**: $23M payment due Week 4 (30-day terms)
- **Electronics components**: $18M weekly deliveries
- **Fasteners and hardware**: $8M monthly consolidated payment

**Day 4**: Capital expenditure planning
- Manufacturing equipment: $15M Q2 deliveries
- Facility upgrades: $8M construction payments
- IT infrastructure: $2.3M software and hardware

**Day 5-6: Model Consolidation and Scenario Planning**
**Day 5**: Base case scenario development
- Consolidate all inputs into master cash flow model
- Validate against historical patterns
- Cross-check with budget and forecast assumptions

**Day 6**: Sensitivity analysis
- **Optimistic scenario**: 10% better collections, 5% delayed expenses
- **Pessimistic scenario**: 15% collection delays, 10% expense acceleration
- **Stress scenario**: Major customer payment failure

**Day 7**: Executive review and refinement
- CFO review with department heads
- Challenge assumptions and adjust projections
- Finalize forecast for covenant testing

**Traditional Forecast Results (April 8):**
```
13-Week Cash Flow Forecast - Base Case
Week Ending: April 30, 2024

Cash Beginning: $67M
Operating Inflows: $743M
Operating Outflows: $721M
Net Operating Cash Flow: $22M
Capital Expenditures: ($31M)
Debt Service: ($12M)
Cash Ending: $46M

Covenant Analysis:
Leverage Ratio: 3.2x (covenant: <3.5x) ✓
Interest Coverage: 4.8x (covenant: >4.0x) ✓
```

**Problems with Traditional Forecasting:**
- **Static assumptions**: Weekly updates miss daily changes
- **Limited scenarios**: Only 3 scenarios vs. continuous probability
- **Manual errors**: 8-12% of cells contain formula errors
- **Late identification**: Covenant risks identified with 2-week notice
- **No early warning**: Cannot react to changing conditions

**Challenge**: Inflation impact on consumer discretionary spending
**Board Request**: Multiple scenarios for holiday season planning

### Traditional Quarterly Forecasting Process
**Team**: FP&A Director (Amanda) + 4 Analysts
**Timeline**: July 8-26, 2024 (3 weeks)

**Week 1: Base Case Development**
**Day 1-2**: Macroeconomic assumption setting
- GDP growth projections: 1.8% (consensus economist view)
- Inflation forecast: 3.2% CPI through year-end
- Consumer confidence index: 68 (below historical average)
